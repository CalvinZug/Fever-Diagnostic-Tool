# Fever-Diagnostic-Tool

This program runs as a basic medical diagnostic tool which will ask the user questions about symptoms. After the user responds to a series of questions, the program will give the user a possible diagnosis and reprint the symptoms the user has based off their responses to the questions. The user will then be asked if they would like to run the program again, and the program will continue until the user answers no.
